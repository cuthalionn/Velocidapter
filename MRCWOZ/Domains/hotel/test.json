USERTURN SYSTEMTURN I'm sorry, but there are no 5-star hotels anywhere in Cambridge. Would you like to broaden your criteria? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN How about something with 4 stars and something expensive. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN I have 2 options for you - The Huntingdon Marriott on the west side, and the University Arms in the center. Are you interested in one of these? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Maybe. Is either one a 4 star hotel? If so, I'd like to book a room for 4 nights. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN Both are 4 stars. How many days would you be staying, and how many people are in your party? I can see if something is available. SYSTEMTURN USERTURN I need a reservation for 4 nights starting Saturday. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN How many are in your party? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN 3 people. Can I get the reference number please? USERTURN SYSTEMTURN I'm sorry, but there is nothing available at that time at either hotel. Would you like to try fewer nights or perhaps a different arrival day? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Will you try Sunday arrival? USERTURN SYSTEMTURN Yes, I tried Sunday but it isn't available. Can you shorten your stay at all? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Yes, can you try it for 3 nights, please. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN Neither hotel appears to have three days available starting on Sunday for three people, can I look something else up for you? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN I may have been confusing you. Could you try and book a 4 star, expensive hotel for 3 nights, starting on Saturday? 3 people. Wifi please. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN Sure. I was able to book you for the Huntingdon Marriott Hotel. Reference #IHGCTXH9. Anything else I can help with? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Whew, thanks, sorry for all of the confusion. I think that covers everything. thanks so much for the help. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN You're quite welcome. If you need anything else just message us again. Thanks for contacting the Cambridge TownInfo Centre and have a great day! SYSTEMTURN ",
