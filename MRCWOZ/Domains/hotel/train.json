I could recommend Home From Home, a moderately priced guesthouse in the north. Or are there other factors that matter? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Just free wifi and free parking. Moderate priced and should be a guesthouse please. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN If you tell me when you will be staying, how many people and for how many days, I can book you at he home from home? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN There will be 5 of us staying for 2 nights. We would like to start on Sunday. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN I'm sorry, there were no rooms available. Perhaps you'd like to find another hotel? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN How about a different hotel in the same price range? USERTURN SYSTEMTURN I was able to book you into Kirkwood house. Your reference number is ANO69RVP. Is there anything else I can help you with? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake, we're actually arriving on Friday, not Sunday. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN I was able to book a guest house called Acom guest house. It is moderately priced and has internet and parking. Reference number is 0RA8Y7GS. Would that work for you? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Yes that's great. Thanks so much! USERTURN SYSTEMTURN You're welcome! Have a great day! SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Thanks again for your help USERTURN SYSTEMTURN You're welcome!

One in the east, and one in the north. Do you have a preference? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Are either of those two cheap? USERTURN SYSTEMTURN No I am sorry, they are both in the moderate price range. Would you like to book one of them? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Any one will do as long as it has a 4-star rating with free wifi and is cheap. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN There are no 4-star places that are cheap and have free wifi. Perhaps something not as fancy, or in a higher price range? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN I'm not sure. I really needed those specifications. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN I apologize, we have several options. The alexander bed and breakfast is a cheap four star guesthouse, in the north area, with wifi. Would you care to reserve a room? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Yes, let's book it for 3 nights from Wednesday. There will be 5 of us. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN Okay, I've made your reservation.

USERTURN SYSTEMTURN There are many places that meet that criteria. Do you have any other preferences? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN I prefer a hotel rather than a guesthouse with a rating of at least 3 stars. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN I have nothing with that exact criteria, perhaps something with a bit of a change in criteria? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN How about an expensive one? USERTURN SYSTEMTURN I have Gonville Hotel in the centre and The Lensfield Hotel in the south that both meet your needs. Would you like to book one of these two? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Yes. Either of those should work although I would prefer The Lensfield Hotel since its in the south. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN OK! I can book a room for you if you can tell me the day you're arriving, how many nights you need, and the number of people in your party. SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Please book for 4 people and 5 nights starting from saturday. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN I'm sorry, the Lensfield Hotel does not have anything available then. Would you like me to try the Gonville Hotel for you? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Yes, anything in the same price range will work. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN I was able to book a room at the Gonville for you, ref#AE00VOHE. Can I help you with anything else today? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN No thank you that is all I need today. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN Thank you for using this service. Enjoy your stay. Good bye. SYSTEMTURN ",

If so, I have 12 different options for you. SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Yes, that's right. Which of the 12 options would you recommend? USERTURN SYSTEMTURN How about Archway House? It's at 52 Gilbert Road cb43pe, and the phone number is 01223575314. Would that work for you? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN That's great. Please make a reservation for 1 on Monday. I'd like to stay 3 nights. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN Your booking was unsuccessful. Would you like another day or a shorter stay. SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Yes, would you try 2 nights instead, please?

There are no hotels matching that criteria in the area you are interested in. SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Can you please check again? Hopefully, there was just an error in inputting the information into the search system. Thanks USERTURN SYSTEMTURN I am sorry there is still no match coming up for your criteria.

What is your price range? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN I really don't have a price range in mind. I'm still not sure I want to stay in a guesthouse, hotels are so much better for me.

Its in the west side and is expensive with a 4-star rating. Would that work? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Is there something in the cheap price range? USERTURN SYSTEMTURN There are 2 cheap guesthouses if you still want to stay on the north side of town, they both have internet and parking. Would either of these work? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Yes please.

USERTURN SYSTEMTURN There are many hotels available, do you have any preferences to price or area? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Not really. But it should be in the North. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN There are two hotels on the north end, the Ashley Hotel and the Lovell Lodge. Which would you like? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN I would prefer a guesthouse thats 4 star rated. Do either of those fit the bill? USERTURN SYSTEMTURN No, I'm afraid they're both two stars. Would you like to try one of them anyway? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Do they have free wifi at either of them? USERTURN SYSTEMTURN Yes both have free internet. Which one do you prefer? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN I would really like a four star guesthouse in the north area, I don't need parking. USERTURN SYSTEMTURN Okay, I've found several place that meet those requirements. I suggest the Avalon. Would you like me to make a reservation for you? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN First could you tell me the price range for the Avalon? USERTURN SYSTEMTURN The price range at the Avalon is moderate. Do you have any more questions? SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Yes, can you confirm if the Avalon has Internet, please? USERTURN SYSTEMTURN Yes they does, but no free parking though. SYSTEMTURN USERTURN Cool. Thanks I'm good now. Goodbye.
